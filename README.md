# MBCanCode
A repository to share our codes for research and education, organised by the Marine Civil Engineering Group (MB) at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (IBM), Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.

This is an open-source initiative from the MB research group to share our knowledge and experience on coastal engineering, ocean engineering, arctic engineering, wind energy and other oceanic renewable energy research. The topics of the codes include but not restricted to signal-processing, data-science, machine-learning, optimisation, design and general engineering.

All codes are under GNU General Public License v3.0 open-source license and free to use and for further developments.

You can use these as stand-alone programs or together with our teaching (https://www.ntnu.edu/ibm/marine-civil-engineering) and other software developed within the group, such as SAMS (https://arciso.com/sams/) and REEF3D (https://reef3d.com/)(https://github.com/REEF3D).
